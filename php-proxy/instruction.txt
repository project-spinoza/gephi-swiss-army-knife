1) copy gsak directory to http server root directory (i.e. htdocs, www, etc.).
2) open upload.php with any editor.
3) set $gsak_upload_dir to GSAK upload directory. i.e. Directory to which GSAK uploads file.
NOTE: GSAK automatically creates a directory 'uploads' where GSAK .jar file exits or from where it is executed.
if you don't have uploads directory, create one in directory containing jar file or in the directory from where you gonna run .jar file.
set its path in upload.php file as mentioned above.
4) Run GSAK `java -jar gsak-*.jar` 
5) Access GSAK via 'www.localhost/gsak';
6) direct path without proxy 'www.localhost:9090/gsak'
